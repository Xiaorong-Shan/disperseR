# What is disperseR?
disperseR is a packaged designed based on the hyspdisp package and the SplitR package. It is an R package that runs HYSPLIT many times and calculates the HYSPLIT Average Dispersion (or HyADS) exposure metric. The results can then be aggregated to ZIP code level to create national estimates of exposure from various sources. For example, plumes from several power plants can be tracked for many days and cumulative impacts estimated. disperseR is a new version of hyspdisp. It makes it easier for the user to interact with the functions and computations. disperseR uses some code borrowed from the SplitR package in a slightly modified version.
